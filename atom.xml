    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though I have been very busy these days I think I should try to get at least one post published
per month. My recent job involved a lot of data analysis and statistical computing. I pushed myself
to get familiar with <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> because some packages from R are indispensable for my work. Meanwhile
I also wanted to reuse my existing <a href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a> code. Luckily I get the best of both worlds by using
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppOctave/">RcppOctave</a> which is a bridging package connecting the R and Octave sessions.</p>

<p>I compiled the latest Octave on the server and installed in my home directory. When installing
<code>RcppOctave</code> in R by running</p>

<pre><code>install.packages('RcppOctave') 
</code></pre>

<p>I ran into an error message like this:</p>

<pre><code>** preparing package for lazy loading
Creating a generic function for ‘show’ from ‘methods’ in package ‘RcppOctave’
    (from the saved implicit definition)
** help
Error : /tmp/Rtmp028JZY/R.INSTALL6dea26e533ee/RcppOctave/man/o_addpath.Rd:40: unable to load
shared object '/home/zandy/lib64/R/library/RcppOctave/libs/RcppOctave.so':
liboctinterp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

ERROR: installing Rd objects failed for package ‘RcppOctave’
* removing ‘/home/zandy/lib64/R/library/RcppOctave’
</code></pre>

<p>The build phase seemed OK. Only did the install phase complain. I spent some time and figured out
a work-around is to specify the library path to your <code>liboctinterp.so</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib64/octave/3.6.3
</code></pre>

<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the internal mechanism of <code>install.packages</code> otherwise I may be able to fix
the problem completely.</p>

    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/12/26/vim-gets-slow-when-editing-latex</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have been working on editing multiple LaTeX files containing many lines and equations.
I noticed there was an annoying slowdown when I moved the cursor around. CPU usage jumped to 100% so
frequently that I almost lost patience to focus on the writing itself.</p>

<p>After tweaking the Vim plugins and configurations for a while, I found out <code>set cursorline</code> and the
built-in plugin <code>MatchParen</code> made Vim scrolling very slow. Some people seemed to have run into the
same problem as mentioned <a href="http://haerench.blogspot.com/2012/12/cursorline-cursorcolumn-and-syntax.html">here</a> and <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=111647">here</a>. Some complained that Vim got slow when editing
Ruby file. And I use Vim in terminal.</p>

<p>I have no idea why Vim drawing is so CPU expensive. At this moment I disabled the highlighting of
<code>cursorline</code> and <code>cursorcolumn</code></p>

<pre><code>set nocursorline
set nocursorcolumn 
</code></pre>

<p>I also notice that cursor movements in the equation environment was very slow partially it was
because the math equations had so many parentheses, brackets and braces. Matching pairs and syntax
highlighting easily ate a good amount of CPU cycles. So I turned off this plugin by</p>

<pre><code>:NoMatchParen
</code></pre>

<p>I didn&#8217;t completely disable this plugin since I found that it was useful when editing long
equations. So I didn&#8217;t try this in <code>.vimrc</code></p>

<pre><code>let g:loaded_matchparen=1
</code></pre>

<p>I found some other tweaks by using Vim&#8217;s <code>:profile</code> command and the verbose options <code>vim -V
foo.bar</code>. They are good ways to try to analyze the slowdown.</p>

<p>The lesson I learned:</p>

<ol>
<li>All-around syntax highlighting seems a little bit expensive in Vim. Emacs seems to beat Vim on
this point.</li>
<li>Use <code>autocmd FileType</code> to further tweak the performance, such as disable the
unnecessary plugins.</li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/11/28/fedora-17-and-nvidia-driver/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-28T02:10:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/11/28/fedora-17-and-nvidia-driver</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally I succeeded in installing the nVidia driver on my old Dell Inspiron 530 geared an old nVidia
8300 GS video card running Fedora 17 i386. Here is a quick recap on my journey with Fedora 17.</p>

<p>I started constantly using Fedora 17 half a year ago. I had used the default open source nVidia
driver <code>nouveau</code> happily until the system updated the kernel from the 3.3.4 to some newer version.
None of these newer kernels worked well with the <code>nouveau</code> driver. A common issue was the mouse was
drawn as a big block and the GUI color was totally garbage. I tried to install the nVidia driver
either according to <a href="http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2012/fedora-17-nvidia-guide/">what it said</a> or using the installer from the official website of nVidia.
But neither way worked. I could see the mouse was spinning but the whole system kept froze. So I
excluded the kernel update in <code>yum.conf</code> under <code>/etc</code>. Everything was fine until one day my Fedora
Linux suddenly crashed with a kernel panic error. The traceback message indicated it was about a
kernel bug in the ext4 file system</p>

<pre><code>kernel BUG at fs/ext4/extents.c
</code></pre>

<p>Initially I thought it could be due to certain bad blocks on my hard drive. But soon the hacker news
confirmed that the bug in the kernel was the culprit. After several sudden losses of my working
sessions I couldn&#8217;t wait for any more seconds to update the kernel. And I had to make the Xorg
server work too.</p>

<p>It really bugged me that the nVidia driver didn&#8217;t work on my Fedora 17. I booted from Ubuntu Linux
installed on an external USB disk. And the nVidia driver worked fine under it. There must be
something wrong with <code>akmod-nvidia</code> or the official driver.</p>

<p>Accidentally I found the solution. It appeared that my 8300GS card was not supported very well in
the recent 3xx driver. I guess this type was not very common. I tried <code>akmod-nvidia-173xx</code> and X
server started this time. In my case, I didn&#8217;t need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>Remove / disable nouveau drivers from kernel initramfs
</code></pre>

<p>The remaining issue was the OpenGL apps were indirectly rendered. It was due to the nVidia GL
library was not automatically loaded. The system still used the mesa GL to do the software
rendering. A workaround is to put the following line in <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</code></pre>

<p>Another problem was the dual displays. The default <code>xorg.conf</code> generated by <code>akmod-nvidia-173xx</code>
didn&#8217;t support the twin views. Additionally, <code>nvidia-settings</code> complained the X11 driver was too old
to be configured. Fortunately I had a copy of working <code>xorg.conf</code> at my Ubuntu partition. And here
is what it looks right now.</p>

different letter cases as the same category name. Otherwise the category page wouldn&#8217;t show correct
number of links to the posts under that category. For example, I had to change all <code>git</code> to <code>Git</code> in
the meta info of every posts. Here was what I used to get this job done.</p>

<pre><code>ack "\- git" *.markdown -l | xargs perl -p -i -e 's/- git/- Git/g'
</code></pre>

<p>A little explanation:</p>

<pre><code>-l: ask ack to only show the filename with matched search pattern. You can try first without -l
    option to make sure you find the correct files. And then run with -l option to make the output
    suitable for xargs
-p: read and loop from files instead of STDIN
-i: in-place edit
-e: run the command. Here we do the search and replace operations.

due to the supper fast local internet connection. But when I connected to the remote desktop via
Nomachine, the GUIs of remote applications were very lagging and the redraws seemed out of sync
leaving blanks here and there. I&#8217;ve tried many ways to improve that, including upgrading the ISP
bandwidth, trying the latest NoMachine 4 Preview, tuning the various options in the settings. But
all efforts were vain. Until one day I aimlessly chose KDE in NoMachine and the redraw issue were
gone. Every GUI programs ran perfectly in KDE, both GTK+ ones and non-GTK+ ones.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my everyday work I use Git to do the version control over my dotfiles. I share my .octaverc cross
different computers (four different Linux machine). I also maintain a list of local M-file repos.
Not all repos are available on every machine. To get rid of the warning message for missing
directory every time, I wished I could add my local directories dynamically based on the hostname.
I didn&#8217;t know how to do so until today I found that Octave actually has the function &#8216;uname()&#8217; for
the job. Here is an example ~/.octaverc</p>

<p>You may also notice that I changed the default color of prompt to red for better visual contrast.
Also I defined a function &#8216;man&#8217; to alias the built-in command &#8216;help&#8217; since I&#8217;m more used to type
&#8216;man&#8217;. This tip was copied from Octave mailinglist. Hope you like today&#8217;s post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I wanted to use Perl and Bash to deal with a large number of files. I ended up needing
in-line string substitution to create new shell commands. I vaguely had an idea that I should use
&#8216;sed&#8217; to do the text transform but by any chance I would like to use Perl. I rarely use Perl as
one-liner. It turned out that this is the correct way to do so</p>

    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/08/19/how-to-show-gnome-top-panel-from-keyboard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My computer display is not big so I have tried ways to save my screen real-estate. It looks to me that the designers of GNOME 3 must have a huge display.  The default window title bar are too high in my view. Besides the top panel is thicker than that in Unity. To make my life easier, I first installed the GTK+ 3.x theme from <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">gnome-look.org</a> to reduce the height of the title bar. Then I set the top panel of GNOME desktop to &#8216;auto hide&#8217;. But whenever I want to look at the weather or the time I have to move mouse over it to make it show. This is tedious. I searched online for a shortcut to show it. Many of results are prior to GNOME 3. Besides, I don&#8217;t like the methods to change the &#8216;gsetting&#8217; or &#8216;gconf&#8217;.</p>

<p>It turns out that the simplest way to to hit &#8216;Alt+F1&#8217; to activate the &#8216;Application&#8217; in the top panel and hit &#8216;Esc&#8217; to hide it again. So simple.</p>

<p>BTW: I&#8217;m using the fallback of GNOME 3.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-01T19:39:25-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/07/01/add-the-remote-git-repository-for-your-open-source-collabration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I hacked on github I would clone the upstream repository FOO into my local disk creating a &#8216;master&#8217; branch. I hacked there and formatted a patch to the upstream repo owner. But I quickly found the need that I wanted to have my github-hosted &#8216;master&#8217; branch since I wanted my local hack could be backed up and synced online. So I changed my workflow. For any git project I was interested to hack I would create a new cloned repo my_FOO from the original on github under my owership. Then I git clone this my_FOO/master(origin/master) into a local branch &#8216;master&#8217; and I would hack under this branch.</p>

<p>But after my hack right before I fire up the &#8216;git format-patch&#8217; command, I would like to have  a updated upstream master branch available so that I can format my patch to the latest code base. Also I would like to update the code from the upstream everyday to keep tracking the latest changes. The command &#8216;git remote&#8217; will help. I found a good documentation on this issue. Check it out <a href="http://gitref.org/remotes/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a short summary:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Suppose the original project is called FOO. We create a new repo called my_FOO by imported the code from the git repo of FOO</p></li>
<li><p>git clone git://git.github.com/my_FOO.git. You will have a local master branch</p></li>
<li><p>git remote add FOO_origin git://git.github.com/FOO.git. You will add a new remote repo in your .git/config</p></li>
<li><p>git fetch FOO_origin. You have to do this to get the branch information about FOO_origin before step 5.</p></li>
<li><p>git branch &#8211;set-upstream FOO_master FOO_origin/master. Create a local branch named FOO_master to keep track the upstream&#8217;s master branch.</p></li>
<li><p>Done. use &#8216;git branch&#8217; to check the result.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>OK. After these steps, you can code in the &#8216;master&#8217; branch, commit and push to the repo &#8216;my_FOO&#8217; for the benefit of online backup and sync. You can switch to FOO_master to pull the upstream changes and merge to your &#8216;master&#8217; branch. When you feel ready to format a patch, just type &#8216;git format-patch FOO_master&#8217;.</p>

<p>Of cause there are issues like commit squash but that is another topic so I don&#8217;t mention here. I&#8217;m surprised to see there are tons of git questions flying around on the web. After all git is really a complicated tool with a much higher learning curve than Subversion. For some particular use cases I find it make sense to blog them here for my own future reference instead of searching online but retrieved a lot of partially related answers.</p>

Everytime I hit &#8216;tab&#8217; to complete a directory name, Bash didn&#8217;t append the backslash nor printed out candidates (just like what it described like <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1053832">here</a> and <a href="http://timlabath.com/words/2011/05/10/ubuntu-11-04-and-broken-bash-completion/">here</a>). It drove me banana. Meanwhile, my Bash worked very well under other Linux distributions (openSUSE, CentOS). The culprit was the a Bash completion file for adobe acrobat reader under /etc/bash_completion.d/. Delete it and the problem will be solved.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally, my search for a good Makefile for LaTeX  document writing  was ended by this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/">solution</a>. You may have heard about <a href="https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/latex-utils/">latex-makefile</a> or <a href="http://latex-mk.sourceforge.net/">latex-mk</a> or other LaTeX makefiles. But either they are too complicated, dependent on other external programs, need to install before use or not  powerful enough to get the most jobs done. Here, this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/">latex-makefile</a> is light-weight, self-contained, zero-dependent and powerful to deal with most cases. Simply download it, drop into the same directory with your LaTeX source file and you are ready to go. Its colorful output really makes error-checking much easier. I like it very much. Highly recommend it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a job interview two months ago, no matter how hard I tried I simply couldn&#8217;t export the screen of my laptop running Ubuntu Linux to a projector. It was the first time that I linked a Linux computer to a projector. Luckily the interviewers were generous enough and the four people of us sat together tightly to watch the slides on my 15&#8221; laptop screen. They gave me a job offer in the end but I just hoped that I could have done a better presentation that day.</p>

<p>I searched for a solution for that on the web. It seemed a headache for many Linux users. Finally I ran into <a href="http://willem.engen.nl/projects/disper/">Disper</a>. It solved my problem perfectly.</p>

*** No rule to make target <code>gtkcolorsel.c', needed by</code>libgtk_3_la-gtkcolorsel.lo&#8217;. Stop</p>

<p>The reason for that is because the output files from previous builds make Automake unhappy.</p>

<p>The solution is
enter the jhbuild shell, and do: git clean -xdf</p>

<p>More details from GTK+ IRC: automake does not like when files get moved around so you need to clean up the build tree and get it back into a pristine state</p>

    <updated>2012-02-09T11:08:38-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/02/09/finally-gnome-3-on-opensuse</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After upgrading from openSUSE-11.4 to 12.1, I have spent two days on tweaking GNOME3 to make it
usable. Phew.</p>

<p>Initially, GNOME3 (gnome-shell 3.2 precisely) was unable to start at all. .xsession-errors showed
that Clutter failed to start. A deeper reason was that Clutter wasn&#8217;t able to find the proper nVidia
graphics driver libGL*.so. If you type</p>

<pre><code>ldd /usr/bin/gnome-shell
</code></pre>

<p>You would notice that libGL.so.1 was pointing to nothing. That was bad.</p>

<p>I narrowed down the culprit in my .bashrc. For some reason I have always modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
meet my needs. Everything worked fine until upgrade to openSUSE-12.1. I found from /etc/ld.conf.d
that the nVidia GL libraries had been installed in /usr/X11R6/lib64 and /usr/X11R6/lib which was
missed in my modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH. So the solution was to add /usr/X11R6/lib64:/usr/X11R6/lib in
the front of LD_LIBRARY_PATH. It seemed to have to be the first two in my case. YMMV. I didn&#8217;t run
into the same problem on Ubuntu since the nVidia driver was installed somewhere else.</p>

<p>OK. Gnome shell started but soon I noticed that there was some screen refresh glitches in
gnome-terminal. Every time I typed commands where the cursor was near the bottom, the screen failed
to refresh or output.  I hadn&#8217;t seen it in KDE running the same program. So I guess it again was
related with Gnome-shell. A quick search on the web told me that it was due to some bugs in nVidia
driver with Clutter and  the work around was to add the following line into .bashrc</p>

<pre><code>export CLUTTER_PAINT=disable-clipped-redraws:disable-culling
</code></pre>

<p>Again I didn&#8217;t run into this issue in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>All right. Gnome-terminal worked properly. After further installs of Gnome shell extensions like
Application Menu, Places Status Indicator, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tint2/">tint2</a>, finally my
new GNOM 3 was ready for daily use.</p>

    <link href="http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/02/05/perlbrew-and-opensuse/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-05T00:08:45-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/02/05/perlbrew-and-opensuse</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have heard about how great <a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a> is from time to time on the web but
I have never had a chance to play with it until today. After my openSUSE was upgraded from 11.x to
12.x and system-wide Perl was upgraded from 5.12 to 5.14, my local Perl modules was broken. I think
it is a good idea to have access to multiple Perl distributions and a good management among them.
Soon I realized that it was time to give perlbrew a try. I tried to install a locally built
Perl-5.14.2 by the command</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew install perl-5.14.2
</code></pre>

<p>But quickly it failed with the exactly the same error like
<a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/perl/porters/234587">this</a>. It was about something wrong with
ODBM_File. And this problem seems specific to openSUSE. As the post link said, the solution is</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew install perl-5.14.2 -D noextension=ODBM_File
</code></pre>

<p>This made a good build of perl-5.14.2. I further installed cpanm with perlbrew and replaced the
system-wide cpanm. I&#8217;ve found it a better way to install CPAN modules since by doing so cpanm will
install modules for difference versions of Perl in separate locations. For example, modules for
Perl-5.12 won&#8217;t conflict with Perl-5.14. This is just what I want.</p>

<p>Happy perlbrewing&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool">apt</a> is one of the reasons that I like
Debian/Ubuntu, but type apt-cache search, apt-cache show, apt-get install, apt-get update, apt-get
upgrade is so verbose. To make life easier, I have stolen some ideas from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZYpp">zypper</a> from OpenSUSE by adding the following lines into my
.bashrc:</p>

<p>Now you can just type &#8216;apt se&#8217;, &#8216;apt up&#8217;, &#8216;apt upgrade&#8217;, &#8216;apt in&#8217; and &#8216;apt if&#8217; to do the similar things.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though many Linux distributions have provided TeX packages, I still like  <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html">tlmgr</a> to manage everything. It is like apt-get but just for TeX Live. Management and configuration become much more convenient.</p>
