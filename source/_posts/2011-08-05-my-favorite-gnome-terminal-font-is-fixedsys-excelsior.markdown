Finding a good monospaced font for Gnome terminal was used to be my big wish. I have tried bitstream mono, droid sans mono, inconsola. None of them was satisfactory in Gnome terminal with dark background(much better in white background but I don't like white background). Finally, my heart has been settled down with [fixedsys-excelsior](http://www.fixedsysexcelsior.com/). It just looks very comfortable with my black background.
