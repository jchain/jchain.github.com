I was involved in a tedious GUI testing by hand this week. To make my life easier, I researched online some automated GUI testing framework in this weekend. I quickly spotted four opensource tools: [dogtail](https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/), [strongwind](http://medsphere.org/community/project/strongwind), [ldtp](http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/) and [xnee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnee). After playing around with each of them for a while, I finally picked ldtp as my first choice since it is most active maintained and mature. Moreover, [mago](http://mago.ubuntu.com/) makes life even easier.
