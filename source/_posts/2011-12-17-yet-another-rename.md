I had many randomly named files and directories under my working project. Today I wanted to organize them in a more consistent naming convention. So I needed a file rename tool. Even though Linux base installation has a command 'rename', I soon found this Perl app [rename](http://search.cpan.org/~pederst/rename-1.8/bin/rename.PL) is better thanks to Perl's powerful regex. Plus, its dry-run option is also a very good idea.
