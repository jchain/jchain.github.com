Following Google's C++ coding [style](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) is a good practice. Google even open-sourced its coding style checker [cpplint.py](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpplint/cpplint.py). The suggestion of using const as often as possible is especially a good one. Although there are many coding styles available on the web, following them strictly without a tool won't last long in my real case. I particularly appreciate the public release of cpplint.py. A uniform coding style can finally be seen in our team.
