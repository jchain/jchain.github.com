  1. [UCC](http://sunset.usc.edu/research/CODECOUNT/)(Unified Code Count) is developed by the researchers at [USC](http://www.usc.edu) in C++. It is cross-platform and supports a bunch of languages. The most impressive feature to me is that it can do code complexity analysis, which is very rare for a open-source code counter.

  2. [CLOC](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/)(Count Lines of Code ) is written in Perl. Lightweight, easy to use.

So I would recommend every programmers to have both in their arsenal.
