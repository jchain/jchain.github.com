After about one month porting work on wxWidgets with GTK+3.0, we finally made the wx-gtk+3.0 build possible. The wx/samples/minimal is working as shown below even though the status bar doesn't show up. For preview purpose of course.

Work will continue on porting drawing code with Cairo as what gtk+3.0 does by default. More samples will be built and tested. Stay tune.
