Finally, my search for a good Makefile for LaTeX  document writing  was ended by this [solution](http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/). You may have heard about [latex-makefile](https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/latex-utils/) or [latex-mk](http://latex-mk.sourceforge.net/) or other LaTeX makefiles. But either they are too complicated, dependent on other external programs, need to install before use or not  powerful enough to get the most jobs done. Here, this [latex-makefile](http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/) is light-weight, self-contained, zero-dependent and powerful to deal with most cases. Simply download it, drop into the same directory with your LaTeX source file and you are ready to go. Its colorful output really makes error-checking much easier. I like it very much. Highly recommend it.
