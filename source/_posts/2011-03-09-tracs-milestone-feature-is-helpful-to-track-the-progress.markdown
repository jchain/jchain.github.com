I have used several project management software before. But today I found that the milestone feature in Trac very impressive. At the beginning of a project I can file all the tasks, to-dos, required features to the issue tracking system for a specific milestone. By viewing the progress bar, I can have a clear big picture about the progress of the project. I like this feature very much. Very helpful.
