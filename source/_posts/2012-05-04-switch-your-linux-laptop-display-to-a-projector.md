In a job interview two months ago, no matter how hard I tried I simply couldn't export the screen of my laptop running Ubuntu Linux to a projector. It was the first time that I linked a Linux computer to a projector. Luckily the interviewers were generous enough and the four people of us sat together tightly to watch the slides on my 15" laptop screen. They gave me a job offer in the end but I just hoped that I could have done a better presentation that day.

I searched for a solution for that on the web. It seemed a headache for many Linux users. Finally I ran into [Disper](http://willem.engen.nl/projects/disper/). It solved my problem perfectly.

Read on how to do it in more details [here](http://www.baibhav.com.np/article/6-computer-tips-a-tricks/32-projector-external-monitor-display-problem-on-ubuntu-1110-solved-.html)
