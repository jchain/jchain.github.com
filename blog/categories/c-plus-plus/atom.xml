    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2011/01/12/wired-unicode-problem-in-source-code-file</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I ran into a very wired problem when I was trying to compile a C++ source file. What
I received was like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Evaluator.h:1: error: stray ‘\357’ in program
Evaluator.h:1: error: stray ‘\273’ in program
Evaluator.h:1: error: stray ‘\277’ in program
Evaluator.h:1: error: stray ‘#’ in program</p></blockquote>

<p>I googled this error and it turned out to be there were some invisible Unicode characters in the
source file. I guessed that our team were using different editors and operating systems, and
someone  accidentally inserted one or two unicode characters. It was so bad that they were
invisible!</p>

<p>The first line was a comment so I deleted the whole line and retyped. But the build was still there!
So so wired. I used Linux command-line tool &lsquo;file&rsquo; to detect the type of the source file</p>

<blockquote><p>Evaluatore.h: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) C program text</p></blockquote>

<p>But for the other files in the same directory, &lsquo;file&rsquo; told me that</p>

<blockquote><p>ASCII C program text</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, I NEED ASCII file encoding! I tried gedit and iconv but somehow they both complained the
conversion. So I came up the final idea, use command-line tool &lsquo;cat&rsquo; to<strong> dump it to the terminal
screen</strong> and copy whole content without the first blank space and paste into a new file. It worked.
If you copy and paste whole dumped content you would see the visible unicode. Delete it.</p>

<p>When I dumped the file, I saw an unexpected blank space at the very front of the first line.
I thought it was the culprit. I also noticed that<strong> &lsquo;cat foo.h > bar.h&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t get rid of the
invisible character</strong>.  Copy and Paste!</p>
