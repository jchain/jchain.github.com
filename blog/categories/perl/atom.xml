    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm a little tired of checking out the weather condition via the web browser. In many cases I just want to see a short report in my terminal. After reading <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/zengargoyle/2012/08/not-to-hot-for-mojo.html">http://blogs.perl.org/users/zengargoyle/2012/08/not-to-hot-for-mojo.html</a>, which shows how to use Mojolicious to retrieve the current condition and <a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/4821/get-the-weather-forecast-for-the-next-24-to-48-for-your-location.">http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/4821/get-the-weather-forecast-for-the-next-24-to-48-for-your-location</a>, which shows how to retried the forecast, I finally wrote something like this</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="perl"]</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/env perl</h1>

<h1>===============================================================================</h1>

<p>#</p>

<h1>FILE: weather.pl</h1>

<p>#</p>

<h1>USAGE: ./weather.pl</h1>

<p>#</p>

<h1>VERSION: 1.0</h1>

<p>use strict;
use warnings;
use feature 'say';</p>

<p>use Mojolicious;</p>

<p>my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent->new;
my $dom = $ua->get('http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KCID.xml')->res->dom;
my $temp = $dom->find('temperature_string')->[0]->text;
my $weather = $dom->find('weather')->[0]->text;
say "KCID ", $temp, " ", $weather, "\n";</p>

<p>$dom =
$ua->get('http://api.wunderground.com/auto/wui/geo/ForecastXML/index.xml?query=Cedar%20Rapids')->res->dom;</p>

<p>for my $e ($dom->find('simpleforecast forecastday')->each) {
 my $day = $e->date->day->text;
 my $month = substr $e->date->monthname->text, 0, 3;
 my $weekday = substr $e->date->weekday->text, 0, 3;
 my $condition = $e->conditions->text;
 my $high = $e->high->fahrenheit->text;
 my $low = $e->low->fahrenheit->text;</p>

<p>printf "%s %s %s, Low: %d, High: %d, %s\n", $weekday, $month, $day, $low, $high, $condition;
}
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>This is how it runs from the terminal:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I wanted to use Perl and Bash to deal with a large number of files. I ended up needing in-line string substitution to create new shell commands. I vaguely had an idea that I should use 'sed' to do the text transform but by any chance I would like to use Perl. I rarely use Perl as one-liner. It turned out that this is the correct way to do so</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]</p>

<p>find . -name "*.java" -print | perl -ne 's/java/java.old/g &amp;&amp; print'</p>

    <id>http://jchain.github.com/blog/2012/02/05/perlbrew-and-opensuse</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have heard about how great <a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a> is from time to time on the web but I have never had a chance to play with it until today. After my openSUSE was upgraded from 11.x to 12.x and system-wide Perl was upgraded from 5.12 to 5.14, my local Perl modules was broken. I think it is a good idea to have access to multiple Perl distributions and a good management among them. Soon I realized that it was time to give perlbrew a try. I tried to install a locally built Perl-5.14.2 by the command</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]</p>

<p>perlbrew install perl-5.14.2</p>

<p>[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>But quickly it failed with the exactly the same error like <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/perl/porters/234587">this</a>. It was about something wrong with ODBM_File. And this problem seems specific to openSUSE. As the post link said, the solution is</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]</p>

<p>perlbrew install perl-5.14.2 -D noextension=ODBM_File</p>

<p>[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>This made a good build of perl-5.14.2. I further installed cpanm with perlbrew and replaced the system-wide cpanm. I've found it a better way to install CPAN modules since by doing so cpanm will install modules for difference versions of Perl in separate locations. For example, modules for Perl-5.12 won't conflict with Perl-5.14. This is just what I want.</p>

<p>Happy perlbrewing...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had many randomly named files and directories under my working project. Today I wanted to organize them in a more consistent naming convention. So I needed a file rename tool. Even though Linux base installation has a command 'rename', I soon found this Perl app <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pederst/rename-1.8/bin/rename.PL">rename</a> is better thanks to Perl's powerful regex. Plus, its dry-run option is also a very good idea.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you call external command in your Perl code with system() and your command is very long, you must want to break it into multi-line but the newline characters really get in the way.  Here is a good way, IMHO,  to make the code look neat and clean:</p>

<p>[sourcecode language="perl"]</p>

<h1>Annotate the target and landmark image</h1>

<p>system single_line( "
 convert -background black -fill white label:'Target Landmarks' miff:- | composite -gravity north
 -geometry +0+3 - $target_with_lmk_filename $target_with_lmk_filename
");</p>

<p>sub single_line {
 my @strings = @_;
 foreach ( @strings ) {
 s/\n/ /g;
 s/\r/ /g;
 }
 return wantarray? @strings : $strings[0];
}</p>

<p>[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>Credit due to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3707262/how-can-i-quote-a-long-string-in-perl">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3707262/how-can-i-quote-a-long-string-in-perl </a></p>

<p>The biggest advantage of this method over string concatenation operator "." is that it is easier to re-align your code in Vim since your command is not messed with quotation marks.</p>
