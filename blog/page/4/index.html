  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to create a line plot in Octave today and saved it as a eps file. But no matter how hard I tried I simply couldn&#8217;t change the font size of the plot legend. It was too small in my document. There is already much discussion about it on the web. No tricks worked for me. Finally I realized that what I really cared about was the font size in file output not the gnuplot screen output. So I just tried &#8217;<strong>print(&#8216;foo.eps&#8217;,&#8217;-depsc&#8217;,&#8217;-F:14&#8217;)</strong>&#8217;. The option &#8216;-F:14&#8217; set the default print fontsize to 14. It worked so far so good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my research work, I have to run many many times of the same program with different parameters.
I wrote bash files to make my life easier. But single process of bash is very slow considering
I have a decent computer with 24 cpu cores. My old way to make better use of multicore CPU was to
split my jobs into several separate bash files and run them simultaneously. You can imagine that it
is far from productive when editing these files. They contain overwhelmingly repeated text.</p>

<p>GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/parallel">parallel</a> comes to rescue. I first ran into this post
<a href="http://pebblesinthesand.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/a-srcipt-for-running-processes-in-parallel-in-bash/">http://pebblesinthesand.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/a-srcipt-for-running-processes-in-parallel-in-bash/</a>.
But I quickly found GNU parallel was a better choice. Fully loaded with detailed documentation.
Plus, it was written in Perl. As you may know, I&#8217;m a Perl fan:-). Now my batch file has become like
this:</p>

<pre><code>seq 1 100 | parallel -j 20 single_run.sh {}
</code></pre>

<p>Voilà!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the release of Ubuntu 11.04 is approaching, I took a bold move to upgrade my Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 last night. Maybe not that bold, since the Ubuntu 11.10 is supposed to be stable enough at this moment. I played around with Unity and Gnome3 each for a while and finally chose Unity as my default desktop manager.</p>

<p>At the very beginning, my wireless didn&#8217;t work. It turned out that the wireless adapter drive was buggy with Linux kernel 3.x.x. After switching back to 2.8.x, wireless connection was alive. Both Unity and Gnome3 have impressive visual efftects at first glance. But after a while, especially in term of the usability, I would prefer Unity. Why?</p>

<p>I like the title bar/top panel in Unity very much. It combines the functionality of the conventional window title bar and the top panel. Sure, it mimics Mac OSX but this feature save a lot of laptop screen real estate. While in Gnome3, a time applet seemingly takes up the whole top panel and you can&#8217;t place app shortcuts into it rendering itself less useful.</p>

<p>Both desktop managers have dropped &#8216;Window List&#8217; at the bottom. I have to say I need that back badly. I feel very uncomfortable without it showing. I have no idea how to switch between windows quickly if you have opened 10+ windows. &#8216;Alt+Tab&#8217; is not the right solution. I even think of switching to tiling window manager like wmii, xmonad. Luckily someone suggests <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tint2/">tint2</a> as replacement. I will give it a try immediately when back home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>wxgtk3 is under active development. Today I ran into a <strong>SIGABRT</strong> signal when debugging samples/image. The error message is like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong><em> glibc detected </em></strong> ./image: malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted: 0x0000000000c93180 ***
======= Backtrace: =========

<p>What is &#8221;<em>malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted</em>&#8221; error? I had no clue. I loaded the program in gdb and saw this error happens when a specific line of code having &#8216;new&#8217; operator was hit. It should be some memory allocation violation. I searched it in Google. The returned results showed many bug reports containing this error. Interestingly, a good number of the follow-up replies said the bug was not reproducible and suggested the original  bug reporter submit valgrind log but few did that so these bug reports were marked as invalid.</p>

<p>I guessed most bug reporters were just common users who were not familiar with valgrind. Anyway, the search results suggested me run valgrind to get more information about the memory violation. Luckly, I played with it several month ago and made a not-bad <a href="http://zandyware.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/share-my-newly-created-valgrind-wxgtk-2-9-1-suppression-file/">suppression file</a> customized with wxgtk. Again I ran valgrind with the command like this:</p>

<p>G_SLICE=always-malloc G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind &#8211;leak-check=yes &#8211;suppressions=./wx.supp &#8211;log-file=valgrind.log ./image</p>

<p>Valgrind immediately tracked down where the real problem was. The log looked like this</p>

<p>It turned out that memcpy() at the line 500 in bitmap_gtk3.cpp manipulated overlapping memory. That was the actual culprit. Valgrind even showed the call backtrace to help you to reproduce the bug. Awesome.</p>

<p>I hope this blog entry help you to use Valgrind to locate the bug and fix memory error quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my project of porting wxGTK from GTK+2 to GTK+3, I built GTK+3 from scratch and installed it at a non-standard location. One of the painful things was that the gcc linker complained about the unknown references to glib or functions. The reason was that I had two parallel glib-2.0.so, one was the system default at /usr/lib64, the other was from my custom build. In the makefile, the gcc linker was given three -L options, something like</p>

<blockquote><p>-L/usr/lib64 blah blah blah -L/home/foo/gtk3/libs blah blah blah -L/usr/lib64</p></blockquote>

<p>Apparently, one of two options -L/usr/lib64 took higher priority in the library search order so that my custom glib-2.0.so was not found. But which one was the culprit? I did a little experiment and it turned out that the first masked my custom GTK+3 lib path. So the conclusion is if you have several -L<dir> options the library search order will be &#8216;first-come-first-search&#8217;.</p>

<p>The next question is how to solve it. In the makefile, linker flags were specified by something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>$(CXX) blah blah blah $(LDFLAGS) $(EXTRALIBS_FOR_GUI) $(LIBS)</p></blockquote>

<p>In my case, the default setting for $(LDFLAGS) is &#8216;-L/usr/lib64&#8217;, $(EXTRALIBS_FOR_GUI)=&#8217;-L/home/foo/gtk3/libs&#8217; and $(LIBS)=&#8217;-L/usr/lib64&#8217;. Since the makefile was generated by configure which is effected by the environmental variables such as LDFLAGS, doing the following solved my problem:</p>

<blockquote><p>export LDFLAGS=&#8217;-L/home/foo/gtk3/libs&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>re-run configure</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary. But hope this post can give some hints for your own problems especially if you use parallel libraries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I fixed a bug in C code today and it was so nasty that I think it is worth a blog post so that I can keep that in mind.</p>

<p>I called a function which allocated a chunk of memory with malloc() and returned a pointer pointing to that memory. The wired thing is the returned address will change so that the caller get an invalid address(out of the bound of memory). More precisely speaking, the most significant bit changes from 0x7fff&#8230;. to 0xffff&#8230;. I really had no clue about why it would go like that. I even tried to disassemble the C code to check what was wrong. It turned out that the return address in the callee was correct but after returning the address to the caller, the value changed. I wrote another toy program to verify everything and finally I nailed down the reason. The callee function is defined in another C file and it looks like an implicit function to the caller. Somehow, this implicit function changed the address during the call. The compilation was fine even though GCC threw a warning about it. I ignored it at the first place but eventually this warning bit me. After adding necessary definitions in the header files. My program worked like a charm.</p>

<p>The lesson I learned: don&#8217;t ignore the warning messages of compiler.</p>
